### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is React? When and why would you use it?
  React is a front-end framework made to make it easier and faster to build the front-end of web apps. Any time your front-end might benefit from modular, easily reused code components, you would employ it. It is well-known and incredibly versatile in use.

- What is Babel?
  Babel is a Javascript compiler that transforms more modern Javascript code, like JSX, into a version of Javascript that is backwards compatible and can be used by most browsers.

- What is JSX?
  JSX is a syntax that looks like HTML and lets users insert HTML with javascript.

- How is a Component created in React?
   In React, a component is generated by writing a function that produces an HTML fragment. The main program then calls this component to add that piece of HTML to the document.

- What are some difference between state and props?
  Props are "stateless" variables that are given from a parent component to a child component and used by the child component. State, on the other hand, are "stateful" variables that are directly maintained by the component and can endure even after the application is re-rendered.

- What does "downward data flow" refer to in React?
  In React, the term "downward data flow" describes the transfer of information from parent components to their offspring. State and prop variables are included in this.

- What is a controlled component?
  A component that derives its values from props and makes changes via callbacks is referred to as a controlled component. By processing the callback and maintaining its own state, the parent component has control.

- What is an uncontrolled component?
   A component that uses a ref to communicate with the DOM and internally stores its own state is said to be uncontrolled.

- What is the purpose of the `key` prop when rendering a list of components?
  In order for React to recognize when and which component has changed, as well as how it changed, key properties are utilized in component lists.

- Why is using an array index a poor choice for a `key` prop when rendering a list of components?
  Using an array index is a bad idea because it can cause the component to behave in an unstable way. For example, if the array is changed by being rearranged or having items added to or removed from it, that change may affect the component's desired performance.

- Describe useEffect.  What use cases is it used for in React components?
  A React hook called useEffect enables users to do "side effects" like accessing an API, setting a timer, or manually modifying the DOM.

- What does useRef do?  Does a change to a ref value cause a rerender of a component?
  useA mutable reference object is created by the function ref, and its value is set to whatever is supplied to it. In the event that the ref value is altered, the object continues to exist throughout the parent component's lifetime and does not require a component re-render.

- When would you use a ref? When wouldn't you use one?
  When making direct changes to a DOM element without generating a rerender, such as managing focus, you should utilize a ref. Refers are not recommended when utilizing class-based components.

- What is a custom hook in React? When would you want to write one?
  A user-defined hook that can be applied to various components, similar to useState or useEffect, is known as a custom hook. Anytime you have shared functionality among components that can be separated out into its own hook and then called later by the individual components, you would write one.
